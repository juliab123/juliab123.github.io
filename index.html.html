<div style="background-color:powderblue;"> <p> <center> <font size="5" color="Medium Violet Red" style="font-family:'Lobster', cursive;"> What is your favorite book? </font> </p> </center>

<p> <center> <font size="4" style="font-family:'Poiret One', cursive;"> <b> My favorite book is <i> Tuesdays With Morrie </i> by Mitch Albom. <br>
						       If you’ve never read it, I highly recommend that you do, <br> 
						       because, simply put, it will change your life. The author’s <br>
						       former college professor, Morrie Swchartz, has been diagnosed <br>
						       with the deadly ALS, and Mitch has come back to write about the <br>
						       psychologist’s take on death and dying. It will also make you cry. </b> </font> </p> </center> </div>

<div style="background-color:powderblue;"> <p> <center> <font size="5" color="Medium Violet Red" style="font-family:'Lobster', cursive;"> What is the food you like the best? </font> </p> </center>

<p> <center> <font size="4" style="font-family:'Abel', sans-serif;"> <b> Well, that's a tough question, at least, it is for me. <br>
						       I am absolutely in love with waffles, which, by the way, <br>
						       I consider better than pancakes becuase you can put maple <br>
						       syrup and berries and whipped cream on waffles and <i> it will <br>
 					               stay there </i> instead of simply sliding off. Hmmm... but as for <br>
						       food groups, I would say the most important things are cheese and <br>
						       chocolate (and for when you're feeling upset, icecream). </b> </font> </p> </center> </div>

<div style="background-color:powderblue;"> <p> <center> <font size="5" color="Medium Violet Red" style="font-family:'Lobster', cursive;"> If you had the chance, where would you travel to? </font> </p> </center>

<p> <center> <font size="3" style="font-family:'Poppins', sans-serif;"> If I had the money and the time, I would travel all around <br> 
						       Europe. I have always dreamed of visiting: </br>
							 <b> 1. The Buckingham Palace in England <br>
							 2. The Eiffel Tower in France <br>
							 3. The Colosseum in Italy <br>
							 4. The Parthenon in Greece </b> <br>
						       and all the other wonderful places in the same continent <br>
						       with so much to see. If you ever meet me, I probably <br>
						       will seem like I have no desires for anything at all, but <br>
						       travel is one of my secret favorite things to fantasize about. </font> </p> </center> </div>

<div style="background-color:powderblue;"> <p> <center> <font size="5" color="Medium Violet Red" style="font-family:'Lobster', cursive;"> What or who inspires you every day? </font> </p> </center>

<p> <center> <font size="4" style="font-family:'Exo 2', sans-serif;"> Something that inspires me every day is the goodwill that is <br>
							still present in this world, the fact that people are still <br>
							willing to be nice to each other, to look after and take care <br>
							of those in need, to sacrifice their time and effort for the <br>
							greater good. No specific person can ever be used to describe <br>
							this force as a whole, so I cite the mortal virtue of humanity <br>
							as a whole instead. It is much more accurate that way.  </p> </center> </font> </div>

<div style="background-color:powderblue;"> <p> <center> <font size="5" color="Medium Violet Red" style="font-family:'Lobster', cursive;"> Tell us something interesting about yourself. </font> </p> </center>

<p> <center> <font size="4" style="font-family:'Taviraj', serif;"> <b> One thing that you'd never expect to be true about me is that <br>
							my birthday is on the last day of the year, making me the <br>
							youngest out of all the other people in my age group, which <br>
							can be pretty surprising. Also, people find it hard to believe <br>
							that I write poems/books in my spare time, becuase (and I quote) <br>
							I "do not look like a writer," at least, not to them. </b> </p> </font> </center> </div>

<div style="background-color:powderblue;"> <p> <center> <font size="5" color="Medium Violet Red" style="font-family:'Lobster', cursive;"> What do you regret doing or not doing? </font> </p> </center>

<p> <center> <font size="4" style="font-family:'Signika', sans-serif;"> I don't really think that there is anything that I regret that <br>
							I have already done, so I won't go into that. But as for things <br>
							I regret not doing, I regret not being more open about my feelings <br>
							to people around me, I regret not taking control of my life and <br>
							following others blindly in hopes that it might get me somewhere. <br>
						   	In the end, I regret so much, yet, at the same time, so little. </font> </p> </center> </div>

<div style="background-color:powderblue;"> <p> <center> <font size="5" color="Medium Violet Red" style="font-family:'Lobster', cursive;"> What advice would you give to a teenager? </font> </p> </center>

<p> <center> <font size="4" style="font-family:'Alegreya', serif;"> <b> Every teenager needs to own up to what they are really, truly <br>
							thinking, to what they really want. The moment they confess <br>
							their true desires, the moment they reveal their true selves, <br>
 							the moment they let everyone see what is really behind the <br>
							mask, that is the moment they become an adult. Finally. </b> </font> </p> </center> </div>
